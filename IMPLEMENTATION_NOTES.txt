PDF AND PNG VIEWING IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
==========================================

FILES CHANGED:
--------------
1. DocumentManagementSystem.java - Main changes to support PDF and PNG viewing

CHANGES MADE:
-------------

1. REMOVED Apache PDFBox Dependencies:
   - Removed: import org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument;
   - Removed: import org.apache.pdfbox.rendering.PDFRenderer;
   - Removed: import javax.swing.ImageIcon; (duplicate)

   Added: import javax.imageio.ImageIO;

2. ADDED PNG/Image Viewing Support:
   - Supports: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP files
   - Uses Java's built-in ImageIO library (no external dependencies needed)
   - Displays images in a scrollable dialog with metadata table
   - Shows full image with smooth scrolling

3. CHANGED PDF Viewing Approach:
   - Instead of trying to render PDF in Java (requires PDFBox library)
   - Now opens PDFs in the system's default PDF viewer
   - Uses Desktop.getDesktop().open() method
   - Shows metadata in dialog with "Open PDF in External Viewer" button

HOW TO USE:
-----------

1. Compile the project:
   javac *.java

2. Run the application:
   java LoginFrame

3. Upload PNG or PDF files:
   - Click "Upload" button
   - Select a PNG, JPG, or PDF file
   - Enter metadata (category, topic, tags)

4. View files:
   - Select a file from the list
   - Click "View" button
   - For PNG/images: Image displays directly in the application
   - For PDFs: Click "Open PDF in External Viewer" button

SUPPORTED IMAGE FORMATS:
------------------------
- PNG (.png)
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- GIF (.gif)
- BMP (.bmp)

WHY THIS APPROACH:
------------------
1. Apache PDFBox requires external JAR files that weren't in your project
2. Using system PDF viewer is simpler and more reliable
3. ImageIO is built into Java - no dependencies needed
4. This solution works out-of-the-box without additional setup

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
--------------------
1. Recompile: javac *.java
2. Run: java LoginFrame
3. Upload some PNG or PDF files to test
4. Click View to see them

NO ADDITIONAL LIBRARIES NEEDED - Everything now uses Java standard library!
